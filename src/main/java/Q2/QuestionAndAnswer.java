/*
* Briefly answer the following questions:
*
* 1. What is the primary difference between a Set and a Map?
*
* 2. What happens when you add a primitive type (e.g., double) value to a collection?
*
* 3. Can you print all the elements in a collection without using an Iterator? If yes, how?
*
* Answer:
*
* 1. The primary difference between Maps and Sets is that Maps contain keys and values, whereas Sets contain only values.
*
* 2. Autoboxing occurs when you add a primitive-type value to a collection because they store only references to objects.
*
* 3. Yes you can print all the elements in a collection without using an iterator, you can print elements by using a
*    standard for or forEach loop. You can also use the Arrays.toString(arrayNameHere) method.
